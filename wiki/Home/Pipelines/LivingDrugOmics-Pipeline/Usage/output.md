# Output
## Where to find output
The directory of the output can be adjusted using the `outdir` parameter. If this parameter is not overridden via the parameters file or command line arguments, the output will be written to `car-flow/output`.

## Structure of output
Each pipeline run generates a dedicated subdirectory within the output directory, named according to the run's name.
The final outputs of the pipeline (e.g., Seurat Object, MultiQC Report) are organized into their respective folders.
Sample-specific results (such as Cell Ranger outputs or FastQC reports) are stored in subdirectories named after the corresponding sample.

### Results

- **`*_reference`/**: Directory for each reference used in the pipeline

- **`seurat_merged.Rds`**: Seurat object including results from the Space Ranger multi. Stores integrated single-cell RNA-seq data for downstream analysis.

- **`multiqc/`**: Aggregated MultiQC report for single-cell sequencing data.

- **`pipeline_info/`**: Nextflow pipeline log data. Contains logs and information related to the execution of the Nextflow pipeline.

### Sample specific output 

- **`fastqc/`**  
  FastQC report for each FastQ file:  
  Performs quality control checks on raw sequence data.

- **`fastqs/`**  
  FastScreen output:  
  Verifies that sequencing runs contain the expected types of sequences by testing against genomes in `car-flow/assets/fastq_databases`.

- **`multi_out/`**  
  [Cellranger output](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger/latest/analysis/running-pipelines/cr-3p-multi):  
  Contains the output from the Cell Ranger multi pipeline.

## Seurat object
The pipeline creates a merged Seurat object (`seurat_merged.Rds`), which includes all samples and their respective data types generated using 10x Genomics libraries.

Gene expression data is stored in an assay called "RNA," while Antibody Capture information is stored in an additional assay called "ADT."

Additional information is included as metadata, comprising quality scores, the abundance of mitochondrial and ribosomal genes, cell cycle scores, and doublet removal information.
