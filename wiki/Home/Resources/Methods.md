# Sequence Retrieval and Annotation Process
## Sequences (fasta)
Sequence information of CAR T cell products (CAR constructs and vectors systems) has been collected from literature and patents (see sources in table below). All DNA sequences were extracted from those sources using a Jupyter Notebook script (`translate_sequences.ipynb`). This process leverages a custom template matching approach implemented in the Python script `template_matching.py`. The method applies structural similarity (SSIM) to detect nucleotide templates (A, C, G, T) from .png images and accurately reconstruct them into a nucleotide sequence string. Annotation process is desribed below. To ensure correct sequences, CAR constructs were manually re-check subsequently.

**Code**: [translate_sequences.ipynb](https://github.com/fraunhofer-izi/TODO/-/blob/add-scripts-to-pipeline/Resources/extracted_pages/translate_sequences.ipynb?ref_type=heads)

## Annotations (gtf)
### 1. Download known protein sequences
For annotation, known nucleotide sequences of CAR construct parts were retrieved from NCBI, following the schematic from: [Grahnert et al., Biomedicines (2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12081641)

**Domains retrieved**:  
- CD28, CD3ζ, 41BB, CD8, CSF2RA  
- Accession numbers: `"NM_001378516.1", "NM_171827.4", "NM_001561.6", "NM_001410981.1", "NR_027760.3"`

**Fetched Sequences**:  
[`fetched_sequences.fasta`](https://github.com/fraunhofer-izi/TODO/-/blob/add-scripts-to-pipeline/Resources/extracted_pages/fetched_sequences.fasta?ref_type=heads)

### 2. Comparison with known annotations
Each CAR construct was aligned against the retrieved domain sequences using BLAST. When applicable, annotations were compared with the original source data (`annotation_from_nucleotide_seq.json`) and compiled into a `.gtf` file.

- **Full Annotation Script**: [`get_annotations.py`](https://github.com/fraunhofer-izi/TODO/-/blob/1b1148904205e7c43620f96ab9d8ebc27f621b18/Resources/extracted_pages/get_annotations.py)
- **Annotation File**: [`annotation_from_nucleotide_seq.json`](https://github.com/fraunhofer-izi/TODO/-/blob/add-scripts-to-pipeline/Resources/extracted_pages/annotation_from_nucleotide_seq.json?ref_type=heads)

### 3. Comparison with DNA domain prediction
All CAR sequences were additionally translated into protein sequence, and screened for protein domains with [SMART](http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/smart). Based on protein position of predicted domains, nucleotide sequences were extracted [`find_nucleotide_from_protein.py`](https://github.com/fraunhofer-izi/TODO/-/blob/add-scripts-to-pipeline/Resources/extracted_pages/find_nucleotide_from_protein.py?ref_type=heads).
