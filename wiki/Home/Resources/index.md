# Resource on CAR T-Cell Therapies
This repository serves as a resource and is designed to support the analysis and development of CAR T-cell therapies by providing comprehensive sequence and annotation data. Given the significant differences in CAR constructs, it is essential to have a tailored approach to the detection of CAR+ cells e.g. with single-cell sequencing. Furthermore, the choice of vector used for transfection affects the efficiency, safety and stability of gene transfer. Therefore, we also include known sequences and annotations of vector systems that can be used in integration site analysis to assess integration patterns in the host genome.

## Key Features

- **CAR constructs**: Includes detailed sequence and annotation data for the latest CAR T cell therapies. These data is crucial for researchers to understand the specific characteristics and behaviors of different CAR constructs. For a more in-depth explanation about the different CAR constructs see: [CAR constructs](./CAR-constructs.md)
- **Vector Systems**: Provides whole vector information necessary for performing integration site analysis. This helps in understanding how CAR constructs integrate within the genome, which is important for evaluating the safety and efficacy of the therapy. For a more in-depth explanation about the vector systems, see: [Vector systems](./Vector-systems.md)
- **Continuous Updates**: This repository is designed to be continuously updated with new data and resources as they become available, ensuring that users have access to the most current information in the field of CAR T-cell therapy.
