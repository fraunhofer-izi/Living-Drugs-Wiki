# Multi-Modal Molecular Analyses for Living Drugs {.home}
Cellular immunotherapy harnesses the power of living cells — such as genetically engineered T cells — to actively seek out, recognize, and eliminate diseased cells, making it a ground-breaking cancer treatment. One of the most advanced forms of this therapy is CAR-T cell therapy, where T cells are modified to express a Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) — a synthetic receptor that enhances their ability to identify and attack cancer cells. However, beyond the high cost, significant challenges remain, from minimizing side effects to ensuring the therapy is precisely tailored to each patient’s unique health profile.

A unique aspect of adoptive cellular immunotherapies, such as CAR T cell therapies, is that they are **"living drugs"**, meaning that they are themselves biological systems that continue to evolve and respond in the patient's body. Given the complexity of these therapies, tailored computational biology is essential to study such heterogeneous systems. We therefore apply advanced multi-modal singel-cell **technologies** and develop computational **pipelines**, in order to study adoptive cellular immunotherapies. While all currently approved adoptive cellular immunotherapies are based on CAR T cells, each specific therapy has distinct characteristics. Therefore, we further aimed to provide a comprehensive **resource** of CAR constructs and vector systems used for transfection of these CAR T-cell products.

## CERTAINTY
In order to address current hurdels CAR T cell therapies we are part of the EU project **CERTAINTY**, which aimes at developing a **virtual twin** for the treatment of cancer patients with CAR-T cell therapies. This will be achieved by building on biological models and real-world data, which will be designed to mimic and predict the behaviour of real patients. The virtual twin aims to support doctors and patients by offering insights that may guide decisions during treatment, contributing to a more informed approach to cancer care.
